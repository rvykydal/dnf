To add installation profiles to Boltron repos do following:

Use a Boltron docker image or any other installation with
repo baseurl pointing to:
https://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/alt/unofficial/releases/26/Server/$basearch/os/

Put this repo somewhere and create a repofile pointing to it in /etc/yum.repos.d.

DNF will automatically merge Boltron module metadata with installation profiles.
